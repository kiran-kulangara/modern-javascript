### Garbage collection

The main things to know:

- Garbage collection is performed automatically. We cannot force or prevent it.
- Objects are retained in memory while they are reachable.
- Being referenced is not the same as being reachable (from a root): a pack of interlinked objects can become unreachable as a whole.
